            <h5 class="history-carousel-text">The Golden Era of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) started when Vince McMahon Jr bought the company from his father and turned it into the worldwide hit it is now. This era went form 1980 to 1993 and saw the WWF come to TV all across the United Sates and outgrow all of its competitors at the time. During this era, famous wrestlers such as Hulk Hogan, Andre the Giant and Randy Savage were signed and big events such as Wrestlemania and the Royal Rumble were created.</h5>

            <h5 class="history-carousel-text">The New Generation Era spans from 1993 to 1997 and started beacuse of reports that some WWF wrestlers were using steroids. This caused Vince McMahon to bring in new talent with now big names such as Bret Hart, The Undertaker and Yokozuna among many. WWF also created their first weekly TV show with RAW and the formation of a famous wrestling stable known as the nWo. This success was short-lived as a newer wrestling promotion called the WCW had signed Hulk Hogan and many other WWF wrestlers followed suit. </h5>

            <h5 class="history-carousel-text">The Attitude Era was started when Vince McMahon wanted to match the success of WCW by creating better and more realistic storylines and characters. This spanned from 1997 to 2002 and featured two of the most famous wrestlers of all time, The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin. It was around this time that Triple H was introduced to the scene. The WWF's popularity continued to skyrocket and another TV promotion was created know as Smackdown. It was here where storylines gained a boost in popularity with the Invasion storyline being the most famous.</h5>

            <h5 class="history-carousel-text">In 2002 the WWF was forced to rebrand itself as World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) after a lawsuit with the World Wildlife Fund and with this rebrand came the start of the Ruthless Agression Era. This era lasted until 2008 and saw a step back from the political side of things and focused more on the wrestling. More major wrestling stars joined during this era such as John Cena, Randy Orton, Batista and Rey Mysterio to name a few. Female wrestling stars also had a surgence during this era when the brand departed from the WWF and attitude era.</h5>

            <h5 class="history-carousel-text">The PG Era was a big step for the company as it decided to be more conservative with its approach to wrestling and made it family-friendly to attract younger audiences. This era lasted from 2008 until 2016 and saw John Cena in his prime as the new face of the WWE and CM Punk as one of the most popular stars. NXT was launched during this era as a reality show which then morphed into the developmental program it is now. The womens division also expanded further during this era, with the Divas Championship introduced to main WWE TV. This was critcised though as the women weren't booked well enough when compared to the men.</h5>

            <h5 class="history-carousel-text">The New Era started in 2016 and saw the division of the WWE roster between RAW and Smackdown with each getting world chmpionships for the male wrestlers. This was paired with the rise of current big name wrestlers such as Roman Reigns, Seth Rollins, Braun Strowman and Drew McIntyre. The womens division also went through big changes with what's known as the women's evolution. This saw the WWE involve more women in the main roster like Becky Lynch, Charlotte Flair and Sasha Banks and introduce the RAW and Smackdown's womens championships. Becky Lynch become one of the biggest stars in the company by main eventing Wrestlemania and Kofi Kingston became the first African born champion.</h5>
